# 🌳 DSA Assignment 2 – Search Mechanism in VectorStore Using Tree Structures

Welcome to the **second project** in the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) assignment series.  
This project focuses on implementing a **search mechanism in VectorStore** using **tree-based data structures**.  
⚖️ **Weight**: This assignment contributes **40%** to the overall grade of the major assignment.

---

## 📖 1. Assignment Specification
- The detailed requirements are described in the file:  
  **`_251_CO2003___DSA__Assignment_2_VI.pdf`**  
- 👉 Please read this document carefully before starting your implementation.  
- At the end of the specification, you will also find the **commands to compile and run** your code. Simply copy and paste them into your terminal.

---

## 🧩 2. Files You Can Modify
- ✅ Allowed to edit:
  - `VectorStore.cpp` → contains the implementation of the search mechanism.
  - `VectorStore.h` → contains the declarations of the VectorStore class and methods.
- ❌ Not allowed to edit:
  - `main.h`
  - `utils.h`
- 📝 Optional:
  - `main.cpp` → you may write your own test cases here to verify your code before submitting to LMS.

---

## 🧪 3. Test Cases
- Standard test cases are provided in the repository and used by instructors for evaluation.  
- Additionally, **special test files** have been collected from university peers for deeper validation:  
  - Source: 👤 **Võ Tiến** → [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Shiba.Vo.Tien)  
- These extra tests can help you stress-test your implementation and ensure robustness before submission.

---

## ⚙️ 4. How to Run
- The exact compilation and execution commands are already provided in the **specification file** (scroll down near the end of the requirements).  
- Just copy and paste those commands into your terminal to run the program.

---

## 🌟 Notes
- Language used: **C++ (100%)**.  
- Only `VectorStore.cpp` and `VectorStore.h` will be graded when submitted to LMS.  
- Use `main.cpp` for your own testing, but do not submit it.  
- Make sure your implementation strictly follows the specification to avoid penalties.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements
Special thanks to **Võ Tiến** → [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Shiba.Vo.Tien)  
for providing additional test cases that greatly improved the quality and reliability of this project.

💡 **Tip**: Begin with the specification file, implement the required functions in `VectorStore.cpp` and `VectorStore.h`, then validate thoroughly using both the official and special test cases.
